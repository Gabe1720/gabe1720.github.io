  **15 Minutes or It’s Free** is an arcade-style twin-stick shooter where you play as a pizza delivery driver navigating the apocalypse. This game combines fast-paced action with strategic gameplay elements.

  *Created alongside my team for a school project.*

  **Some of my contributions:**
  
  - Developed physics-based arcade-style car movement for responsive and dynamic driving mechanics.
  - Designed a weapon pick-up and swapping system to enhance player choice and strategy.
  - Implemented AI enemies that dynamically pursue the player, increasing the challenge and excitement of the game.

  **Technical tools:**
  
  - Unity
  - C#
  - Github

  **Challenges:**
  
  - Faced time constraints with a rapidly approaching deadline.
    - **Solution:** Rescoped and pivoted the game’s design direction to better align with time constraints and the core game concept. This involved cutting unnecessary features and adjusting the design to maintain a focus on keeping the player in the action.

  **Learning Outcomes:**
  
  - This project taught me the importance of understanding a game's strengths and designing to maximize those strengths. By focusing on what made the game fun, I was able to create a more engaging player experience.
