description: >
  Colossal Kickoff is an action-packed asymmetrical soccer game that blends ancient mythology with modern gameplay mechanics. Created as part of my capstone project, this game features dynamic AI that roams and chases the player using state machines, as well as a variety of monster abilities and core gameplay mechanics like dribbling, kicking, and sliding.
  Some of my contributions include:
  - Implemented dynamic enemy AI with state machines.
  - Designed and integrated various monster abilities.
  - Developed core gameplay mechanics for player movement and interactions.
  Technical Tools:
  - Unity
  - C#
  - GitHub
  Challenges:
  - Tackled the complex AI behavior for both warriors and monsters.
  Solution:
  - Used game states to control dynamic AI behavior, ensuring responsive and intelligent enemy actions.
  Learning Outcomes:
  - Gained a deeper understanding of modular game development and the importance of clean architecture, which made it easy to add new levels and features without breaking existing functionality.
