  Colossal Kickoff is an action-packed asymmetrical soccer game involving ancient mythology. Created alongside my team for my capstone project, this game challenges players with dynamic AI opponents and strategic gameplay mechanics.

  **Some of my contributions:**
  
  - Implemented dynamic enemy AI that roams and chases the player using state machines.
  - Developed numerous monster abilities.
  - Created basic gameplay mechanics such as dribbling, kicking, and sliding.

  **Technical tools:**
  
  - Unity
  - C#
  - Github

  **Challenges:**
  
  - Tackling the implementation of AI behavior for warriors and the monster.
    - Solution: Mapped out the solution on pen and paper, using game states to decide character behavior dynamically in-game.

  **Learning Outcomes:**
  
  - This project taught me the importance of modular architecture in game development, allowing me to easily add new levels and mechanics without breaking existing functionality.
