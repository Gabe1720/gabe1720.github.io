## Overview  
Created alongside my team for our capstone project, Colossal Kickoff is a high-energy soccer game with a mythological twist, featuring asymmetrical gameplay where players face off against powerful monsters.  

## My Contributions  
- **Dynamic Enemy AI**: Implemented roaming and chasing behavior using state machines for intelligent, dynamic opponent movements.  
- **Monster Abilities**: Designed and implemented numerous monster abilities that challenge player strategy and adaptability.  
- **Core Gameplay Mechanics**: Developed the essential mechanics of dribbling, kicking, and sliding, providing smooth and responsive player controls.  

## Technologies Used  
- Unity (C#) for game mechanics and AI behavior.  
- GitHub for version control and collaboration with team members.  

## Challenges Faced  
One of the main challenges was implementing AI behavior for both warriors and monsters, ensuring fluid and realistic interactions.  

### Solution  
To overcome this, I mapped out solutions on pen and paper, focusing on game states that dynamically dictated character behavior. This approach allowed me to efficiently structure the AI logic using state machines, enhancing the gameplay experience.  

## Learning Outcomes  
This project taught me the importance of modular architecture in game development. By designing flexible systems, I was able to easily add new levels and mechanics without breaking existing functionality. This experience also strengthened my problem-solving skills and collaboration abilities within a team environment.
