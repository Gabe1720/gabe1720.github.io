I"Å<p><strong>15 Minutes or Itâ€™s Free</strong> is an arcade-style twin-stick shooter where you play as a pizza delivery driver navigating the apocalypse. Created alongside my team for my capstone project, this game combines fast-paced action with strategic gameplay elements.</p>

<p><strong>Some of my contributions:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Developed physics-based arcade-style car movement for responsive and dynamic driving mechanics.</li>
  <li>Designed a weapon pick-up and swapping system to enhance player choice and strategy.</li>
  <li>Implemented AI enemies that dynamically pursue the player, increasing the challenge and excitement of the game.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Technical tools:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Unity</li>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>Github</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Faced time constraints with a rapidly approaching deadline.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Rescoped and pivoted the gameâ€™s design direction to better align with time constraints and the core game concept. This involved cutting unnecessary features and adjusting the design to maintain a focus on keeping the player in the action.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This project taught me the importance of understanding a gameâ€™s strengths and designing to maximize those strengths. By focusing on what made the game fun, I was able to create a more engaging player experience.</li>
